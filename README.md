# week-4-game

A game where you are given random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
You win the game by matching your total score to a random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the ransom number.
The value of each of the crystals is hidden from you until u click on it.
Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each of the crystals.

The index.html file doesnt properly use the javascript file and I couldn't figure out why.
I made an embedded version that actually works as intended
Its really strange because the embedded version is just a copy paste of the index.html.
